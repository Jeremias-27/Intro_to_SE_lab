## **How to Set Up & Run the Project**
Follow these steps to **set up and run the project** on your local machine.

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/seeisalty/Intro_to_SE_lab.git
cd Intro_to_SE_lab

## **2. Set Up a Virtual Environment**
Set up a virtual environment ensures that dependencies are isolated.

For Windows

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

if activation fails on windows try running : Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process

## **3. Install Project Dependencies**
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is missing, install Django manually:

pip install django
Then generate the file:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

## **4. Apply Database Migrations**

python manage.py migrate
If any models are added later, run:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to set a username, email, and password. !!!DO NOT FORGET!!!

You can now log in to the admin panel at:
ðŸ”— http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

## **6. Run the Development Server**

python manage.py runserver
Once running, open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser.
